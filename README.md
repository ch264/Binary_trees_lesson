## Binary Tree vs tries concept
	A tree is a general structure of recursive nodes.
	There are many types of trees such as binary tree and balanced tree.
	Each kind of tree has a different purpose, structure and behaviour. 
	A binary tree stores a collection of comparable items (e.g. numbers) and its structure is sorted so it can be searched quickly to find a single item. (balanced tree is similar in principle). The recursive structure yields a recursive algorithm. A binary tree compares the single searched value to each node.
	Searching has O(h) worst-case runtime complexity, where h is the height of the tree. Since s binary search tree with n nodes has a minimum of O(log n) levels, it takes at least O(log n) comparisons to find a particular node. Therefore the time complexity is O(log(n)) for insertion, deletion and searching. 

	A trie stores sequences of values rather than individual single values in its structure. Each level of recursion says 'what is the value of item 1 of the input list' and does not compare the single searched value to each node as binary trees do.
